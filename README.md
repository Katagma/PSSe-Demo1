# PSSe-Demo
This contains example models and python code to run dynamic simulations of the PSSe example case "SAVNW" using the python API. The SAVNW 
system is an example system provided in the EXAMPLE folder of the PSSe software.

# Getting Started
The mainSim_2021_Demo.py is the main code file to run the simulation. The example models are located in the Demo_Models folder, 
the generated outputs are saved in the Outputs folder. 

Silence.py is a loaded function to the main code that prevents the PSSe outputs
from writing to the python code line. The silence code is not necessary, but it makes the simulations run faster. There are built-in
warning and error checkers in the main code to catch concerning outputs which are not outputted to the python command line due to this
function.
